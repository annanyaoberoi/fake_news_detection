Fake News Detection System 📰🤖

📌 Project Description
The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning based project that identifies whether
a given news article is real or fake. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze text data and classify
news content.

This project demonstrates the practical application of AI, NLP, and machine learning
in solving real-world misinformation problems.

🎯 Objectives
- Detect fake and real news automatically
- Reduce misinformation spread
- Apply NLP techniques on text data
- Build a machine learning classification model
- Demonstrate real-world AI application

🧠 Concepts & Techniques Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Machine Learning Classification
- Model Training & Testing
- Data Preprocessing

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- NLP  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab  

📂 Project Files
- `fake_news.ipynb` → Main notebook file  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  
- `screenshots/` → Output & results (optional)  

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is large and is not uploaded to GitHub due to size limits.

Can use any standard fake news dataset such as:
- Kaggle Fake News Dataset  
- LIAR Dataset  
- ISOT Fake News Dataset  

▶ How to Run the Project
Option 1: Google Colab
- Upload `fake_news.ipynb` to Google Colab  
- Upload the dataset file  
- Run all cells  
Option 2: Local System
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
python fake_news.py

📊 Output
The model predicts whether the given news is Fake or Real based on trained data.
